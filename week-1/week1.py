# Data types include boolean, int, string, and float
# Variables are created in python using the name of the variable, the equal sign, and the variable's value.

# A string value is assigned to the variable named "name"
name = "Bob"

# An int value is assigned to the variable named "pennies"
dimes = 52
# Int data types can be changed or incremented as follows
dimes = dimes + 1
# the left side is the name of the variable being changed
# the right side is the value it is being set to (the previous value of dimes + 1)

# Arrays are a special data type that allows you to store a list of variables, initialized using square brackets and the values
names = ["Bob", "John", "Jill"]

# To access values in an array, we perform array indexing. The first value of an array starts at index 0!

# "Bob"
names[0]
# "John"
names[1]
# "Jill"
names[2]

# We can access variable values and print them to see what they are
print(dimes)
# 52
print(name)
# Bob
